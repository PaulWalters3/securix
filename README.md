# SECURIX
SECURIX is a set of utilities that provide system security, "Unix-like" commands, and other helpful PC utilities for DOS

SECURIX can prohibit unauthorized users from using your system, provided they do not boot from another source such as a floppy drive.  SECURIX provides this service by prompting or a user identification and password to enter into the system.  This password is kept in an encrypted form.  Upon logging into the system, SECURIX executes a shell that has been defined for use by a user.  This shell can be DOS, DOSSHELL, Windows, or any other shell utility.  Upon exiting this shell, the user is logged off the system and a login prompt returns.  Of course this option of logging into the system can be turned off using the SECURIX configuration utility.

SECURIX also provides dozens of other utilities that perform file and directory manipulation, time, date, memory, and other disk functions.  Also, any of these utilities that require pathnames allow a forward slash (/) to be substituted for back slashes (\\).

## System Requirements:

SECURIX can be run on any 8088, 80286, 80386, or 80486 type processor, requiring MS-DOS 3.3 or higher, 2.5 megabytes of free hard disk space, and 640 Kb of memory
